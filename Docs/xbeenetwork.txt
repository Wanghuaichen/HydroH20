XBEE NETWORKING
==================

- Series 1 ( what we have ) cannot create a meshed network, unfortunately. 
However, we can create a point-to-point network were a device asks the logging device for data, and receives it.
--Logger
---collects data, calculates  values -> saves to SD card
---Waits for signal from receiver requesting data
---Sends data values to xbee, transmits to receiver as JSON string

--Receiver
---Scans for devices within the area
---Upon finding device, prompt user to collect data
---Receives/parses JSON response into data file (CSV)
